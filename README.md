# kansas-modem-unlock

Plug-in device framework (flash → root → carrier unlock) with interactive
guidance. Ships with **one verified device** (below); other devices plug in
as data files only after hardware-proven verification (see
`devices/README.md`). Nothing here works on a device it wasn't proven on —
refusal is a feature. An experimental second-device port (nevada, Moto G
Play 2026) lives in `NEVADA.md` — same machinery and gates, not yet proven.

## The 5-minute path

```bash
cp config.json mylab.json   # point firmware_files at YOUR images
python wizard.py --dry-run --work work-wizard     # walk everything, touch nothing
python wizard.py --work work-wizard               # detect -> flash -> root -> unlock
python wizard.py --work work-wizard --phases verify  # health re-check anytime
# nevada, hands-free past rooting (experimental, see NEVADA.md):
python postroot.py --config mylab-nevada.json --work work-nevada --experimental --patches nevada_table.DRAFT.json
```

State resumes from `work-wizard/state.json`; `--phases unlock` (or any
subset) runs just that slice. Every run starts with `setup`: environment
sweep, device + RSA-authorization polling, battery and disk gates.

## Hands-free vs hands-on (what the CLI does vs what you do)

Automated: env checks, RSA wait loops, APK installs (from your configured
copies), opening apps/screens for you, reboot waits, backups, builds,
flashes, health checks, photo/receipt bookkeeping.

You, when asked with exact steps: enable Developer options + USB debugging,
tap Allow on the RSA prompt, in-app taps the tool cannot script (it opens
the screen and verifies the result), cable tricks for fastboot, photos of
screens (screenshots are broken on some builds), typed confirmations.
Nothing advances on assumption: every handoff verifies before continuing. Every destructive step needs typed
confirmation; `--dry-run` performs the whole ceremony against logs only.

## Architecture

- `wizard.py` — interactive runner + device/session layer (Ux),
  state/resume, profile detection and gating. No patch bytes inside.
- `devices/<id>.json` — the entire device definition: fingerprint gates,
  never-flash list, flash plan (user-supplied images + magic checks),
  root recipe, modem patch table, verify acceptance values. Schema v1.
- `flash_mod.py` — denylist (profile + global sacred list), magic checks,
  sha pinning, per-partition typed confirms, post-flash health check.
- `root_mod.py` — guided root with machine-verified gates around a human
  middle (manager app + on-device patch); re-baselines once su passes.
- `unlock.py` + `patches.py` — the proven modem flow, reused by the wizard
  behind a drift guard (profile table must equal patches.py or refuse).
- `sign_mtk_cert.py`, `parse_mtk_certs.py` — vendored re-sign helpers.
- `config.json` — local paths + strictness (never committed with contents).

## Your own key (bootloader phase)

`python unlock.py bootloader` guides an official-style unlock: it shows
get_unlock_data output, you fetch YOUR key from the vendor portal, and
paste it at a hidden prompt. The key travels straight into the one
fastboot command (never shell), is never printed, logged, or written
anywhere, and is wiped from memory after. Plain truth: unlocking usually
factory-resets the phone (vendor behavior) - back up first - and this tool
performs no bootloader patching of its own.

## Experimental mode (red banner, your risk)

`--experimental` enables:

- Untested profiles in the wizard: detection still runs, but flashing
  proceeds only with YOUR patch table (--patches TABLE.json). The tool
  ships zero offsets for hardware it has not proven.
- Custom modem firmware: audit the factory image (stored vs recomputed
digests must match = intact-image proof), apply your table with old-byte
gates, then the byte-exact audit - every differing byte must sit inside
a declared entry with exact old-to-new content, or the build is refused
(tested: merged runs, wrong-old-byte, hostile-extra-byte).

Byte-for-byte means: built equals stock everywhere EXCEPT the declared
set - verified by diff, not by trust. imageaudit.py implements both gates
with stdlib only; RSA checks run where the vendored verifier supports
them, hash consistency is load-bearing either way.

## Fresh machine: CachyOS installer (`setup-cachyos.sh`)

Reproduces this exact toolchain on CachyOS/Arch: pi trio pinned 0.85.1
(server+client included — background subagents fail without them),
pi-subagents 0.65.1 via the `~/.pi/agent/npm` project shape, android-tools
(adb/fastboot, official repos, on PATH by install), node/npm, base-devel,
git, and the python sim packages. Then run `pi auth` yourself — auth,
sessions, and keys are never carried over, by design:

```bash
./setup-cachyos.sh [--yes] [--no-upgrade] [--with-opencode] [--with-java] [--no-python-deps]
```

## Production setup (no manual tool installs)

`python bootstrap.py --yes` fetches official Google platform-tools
(~15-50MB, HTTPS-only dl.google.com) into `vendor/` (git-ignored, never
committed) and verifies them three ways: zip integrity, both binaries
present, `adb version` / `fastboot --version` execute. The wizard offers
the same download automatically on first run (`setup` phase) unless
`tools.auto_download` is off. Strict setups pin an exact URL + sha256
(`config tools.pinned` or `bootstrap.py --url/--sha256`); note Google
rotates the `-latest` zips per release, so there is no stable vendor
checksum to pin against — HTTPS + structure + execution is the check,
stated plainly.

## GUI: plug-and-go window (`manager_gui.py`)

```bash
python manager_gui.py
```

Same backend, clickable: device picker with states, six phase tabs
(Connect → Prep → Flash → Root → Unlock → Verify), command-echo log,
package checklist with ordered per-item-confirm uninstall, firmware file
pickers, typed-confirm dialogs wired into every destructive call, plus a
SIMULATE toggle that streams the dry-run rehearsal into the log instead
of touching hardware. UI conventions follow the classic ADB-manager
pattern (threaded calls, no frozen window). Nothing runs on launch.

## Self-containment (what it brings vs what you bring)

Brings: every script, the patch tables, the re-signer, the audit gates,
the GUI, the docs. Zero pip/npm dependencies (stdlib + tkinter only);
platform-tools self-bootstrap on first run (then works offline).

You bring: Python 3.10+, your firmware images, your APKs, an unlocked
bootloader, root, one device, cable, charge. Firmware/APKs are never
bundled (copyright, size, device-specificity) and never fetched — the
tool verifies what you point it at and refuses the rest.

## Supported devices

| Profile | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kansas` — Moto G 5G (2025) XT2513V, MT6835 P247.01.339R | verified-live | SIM NETWORK_LOCKED→LOADED proven, remain 5, EE 0, revert tested |
| `nevada` — Moto G Play (2026) XT2615V, MT6835N W1WNS36.18-114-1 | experimental | 8/8 table ported (CATI + decode + emu), one locked→LOADED boot, foreign-SIM + revert still open (see `NEVADA.md`) |

Adding one: `devices/README.md` (schema + 6-item hardware-proof checklist).
Untested drafts run audit/status only — flashing refuses.

## Standalone modem tool (same guarantees, no wizard)

Second device? The nevada experimental port (Moto G Play 2026) runs the
same pipeline through `unlock.py --experimental custom` — full story in
`NEVADA.md`.

SIM-lock evaluation patch tool for **one exact device + modem build**:

- Phone: Motorola Moto G 5G (2025) **XT2513V** (`kansas`, Tracfone/Visible)
- Modem: MT6835, baseband `MT6835_NR17.RC.MP.V40.2.P247.01.339R`
- Stock md1img: 75,697,504 bytes, sha256 `371671d3…ab3272`

Provenance: developed against a live lab unit of exactly this build
(SIM state `NETWORK_LOCKED` → `LOADED` for a foreign SIM, remain counter 5/5,
zero modem exceptions, fully reversible). No personal data in this repo:
patch offsets/bytes are identical on every unit of the build; no IMEI,
serial, key, certificate, QR, ICCID, IMSI, or matching ID anywhere
(verified by audit before release).

## What this is NOT (read before anything)

- **Not universal.** It refuses any model, SKU, baseband, image size/hash, or
  bootloader state that isn't the fingerprinted build above. Offsets are
  build-specific; applying them elsewhere is how modems get bricked, so the
  tool says no instead. "Any phone" support does not exist here on purpose.
- **Not a bootloader unlock or root tool.** It *requires* both and checks:
  `securestate: flashing_unlocked` in fastboot + `su → uid 0` over adb.
  Those are per-device processes with their own key ceremonies — out of scope.
- **Never touches identity.** No IMEI read or write, no NCK entry or trials,
  no attempt-counter interaction, no protect/nvram/nvdata writes, never slot B,
  never preloader/lk/gpt/efuse. The patch changes the lock *evaluation*
  (verdict logic), never credentials.
- **Not persistent across modem OTAs.** A carrier/modem update rewriting slot A
  restores stock lock silently. Re-check SIM state after any update.

## What it does (32 bytes)

Eight same-footprint patches to the md1img modem image, then CERT2 re-sign
(accepted by the unlocked bootloader), flashed to **slot A only**:

| # | Site | Change | Effect |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | SML legal-rule entry | `LI a0,1; JRC ra` | Network-link (cat0) evaluation returns LEGAL |
| 2 | SP check entry | `LI a0,1; JRC ra` | Per-category SP-family check returns pass |
| 3–8 | `smu_check_sml` verdict gauntlet (6×) | branch → `NOP; NOP` | Every arrival falls through toward the allow arm |

Total delta vs stock: 32 bytes, image size unchanged. Old bytes are verified
before each write; any mismatch aborts (wrong build = instant refuse).

## Prerequisites

1. The exact device + build above (the tool verifies; don't argue with it).
2. Bootloader unlocked + root (see above).
3. Your own factory `md1img` for this build (integrity-checked by sha256).
4. `adb` + `fastboot` (platform-tools) and `python` on PATH.
5. One device attached, steady cable, charged battery, ~30 minutes.
6. A full backup first (the tool enforces: no backup, no flash).

## Usage

```bash
python unlock.py status                                  # read-only audit
python unlock.py backup --out backups/                  # pull live slot A (200MB)
python unlock.py build --stock FACTORY_MD1IMG --out work/patched.img
python unlock.py flash --image work/patched.signed.img --backup backups/
python unlock.py verify                                 # baseband/SIM/remain/EE
python unlock.py revert --backup backups/               # back to stock backup
python unlock.py full --stock FACTORY_MD1IMG --work work/  # backup+build, then flash explicitly
```

`flash` and `revert` require typing YES. `verify` after every flash is not
optional in spirit: baseband alive, SIM state as expected, remain counter
unchanged at 5, zero modem exceptions in dmesg.

## If something looks wrong

- Flash rejected / boot odd / unexpected SIM state: `unlock.py revert`,
  then `unlock.py verify`. Revert path is why backups are mandatory.
- Fastboot always reachable via Vol-Down+Power (cable-insert trick if looping).
- Never `fastboot -w`, never erase partitions, never flash slot B.

## Files

- `unlock.py` — the tool (stdlib only).
- `patches.py` — fingerprint + 32-byte patch table.
- `sign_mtk_cert.py` — CERT2 re-sign helper (vendored, unmodified).
- `LICENSE` — MIT.

## Legal / safety notes (short)

Unlocking a phone you own for interoperability (other carriers, private/test
networks) is lawful in many places (e.g. US Unlocking Consumer Choice Act),
but rules differ by country and carrier contract — your responsibility to
check yours. This tool changes lock evaluation only; it does not alter device
identity, bypass stolen-device blacklists, or touch network authentication.
Radio operation stays subject to your national regulator (power, bands,
equipment authorization); a lab belongs on cables/attenuators or licensed
spectrum, not on hope. No warranty; you flash at your own risk.
